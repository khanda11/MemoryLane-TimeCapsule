Check out a [live demo video of MemoryLane](https://www.loom.com/share/40dcca6fae6e46a5ae0034476fc4f729) to see the app in action!

MemoryLane is an iOS application that allows users to create, manage, and unlock memories to be unlocked at a later date, much like virtual time capsule entries. Users can store their treasured memories and set a future unlock date for each entry. This app is built using a combination of Swift, SwiftUI, and a backend powered by TypeScript and MongoDB.

Features:

Create Time Capsule Entries: Users can create entries with titles, descriptions, and set a future date when the entry will be unlocked.
Locked/Unlocked Entries: Entries are categorized as locked or unlocked based on the current date relative to the set unlock date.
User Authentication: Secure login and registration process.
Dashboard View: Overview of all the user's entries, with options to view details or create new entries.
Options Menu: Additional settings and functionalities accessible through the Options menu.
Onboarding: A guided onboarding process for new users to understand the app's functionality.
